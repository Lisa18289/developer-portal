Currently, we offer the following libraries:

- The [**mittwald API client** library `@mittwald/api-client`](https://github.com/mittwald/api-client-js) is an auto-generated client for the mStudio v2 API. It can be used in both Node.js and browser applications.

Coming soon:

- A higher-level library of functionalities building on `@mittwald/api-client`
- A library of React hooks for directly accessing API functionalities from your React App
